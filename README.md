Image quality assessment using convolutional networks using the Photo.net dataset.

# Warning

1. This is not the state of the art. This was done for a uni project and there a lot of things that can be improved. One good implementation of this topic is [NIMA](https://github.com/titu1994/neural-image-assessment).
2. The docs are in PT-BR
